- **Firebase Authentication**: Manages user sign-up and login, providing secure access to personal watchlists.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Memory Management on Vercel
During deployment, memory allocation issues were encountered due to the complexity of the build process. This was resolved by optimizing the Parcel build process and adjusting Node.js options to increase memory allocation during deployment.

### Firebase Security Rules
Ensuring that user data was protected and only accessible to authenticated users was a priority. Firebase security rules were implemented to restrict access, preventing unauthorized users from accessing or modifying watchlists.
